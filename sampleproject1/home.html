             Our sight is so important to us and yet many people fail to look after their eye health which unfortunately can lead to sight impairment or even vision loss.

The Eye Doctors of Ireland encourage people to take positive steps to protect their sight, an action aimed at ultimately improving the nation's eye health and contributing towards a 
            reduction in avoidable sight loss.
            What it is about
Globally there are 39 million blind people and 246 million people with moderate and severe vision impairment (WHO data 2010). According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report these numbers are even less (32,4 / 191).  More significantly the GBD uses the same methodology over time, and shows that between 1990 and 2010 the prevalence of blindness fell from 0,6 to 0,46 % globally, and from 0,8 to 0,56 % in sub-Saharan Africa.  Due to overall growth and relative ageing of the population this translates in a small increase in the number of people with vision impairment – but this still means there are 100 million fewer people blind and visual impaired in 2010 than would have been the case with 1990 prevalence rates.

In May 2013 the World Health Assembly adopted the resolution on ‘Universal eye health: a global action plan 2014-2019’. The action plan is centred around universal health coverage achieved in the area of eye health through the provision of comprehensive eye care services integrated into the national health system. The target is the reduction in prevalence of avoidable visual impairment by 25% by 2019 from the baseline of 2010. The new IAPB Strategic Framework 2013-2017 in its main pillars aligns to the global action plan with the mission to achieve universal access to eye health. Its strategic aims are to change government policies, health systems and resourcing decisions to increase access to eye health, particularly for the most marginalised.

Potential impact
A recent study of PriceWaterhouseCoopers, supported by Light for the World, revealed that for every dollar invested in eliminating avoidable blindness in developing countries, 4 dollars’ worth of benefits are returned to individuals, their carers and the development of resource-constrained economies more broadly. 
A systems approach to eye health and the establishment of support structures to overcome barriers to accessing eye health services especially for poor people contributes to strengthening a functional and accessible health system in general.
